Arrays: Is a collection of homogeneous elements, used to store in contiginous memory location.
array allows random access using indices.

In python lists are often used as arrays, but we also have array module NUMPY for numerical operations.

Creating 1D array - using list or NUMPY module.

Ex: array = [10, 20, 30, 40]

Array Module is Type Specific.

Ex: arr = array.arr('i',[1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

Numpy is fast & scientific computing
Ex: 
	import numpy as np
	arr = np.arr[1,2,3,4,5]
	
Accessing array elements - we can access arrray elements using array indexes.
Ex: 
	arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
	print(arr[3])



Permutations - Arrrangement of all the elements in the array in different order.
Ex:
	arr = [1,2,34,6,98]
	[34,6,2][1,6,98][98,2,6]
	
	Formula: The numbers ways to arrange R elements out of n elements.
	
	n!/(n! - r!)
	

Combinations: Selection of elements without considering order.
Ex: arr = [1,2,3]
	[1,2][2,3][3,1]
	
	Order doesn't matter in combinations.
	


 int left = l;
        int right = r;
        while(left < right){
            int temp = arr.get(left-1);
            arr.set(left-1 , arr.get(right-1));
            arr.set(right-1 , temp);
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return arr;
